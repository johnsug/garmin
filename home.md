## Welcome

I'm a self-proclaimed Garmin fan-boy. I love my [Garmin Forerunner 620](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/wearabletech/wearables/previous_models_wearables/forerunner-620/prod122785.html) and use it and the Garmin Connect dashboards frequently to measure and analyze my runs and bike rides. And, when I'm not able to get the insights I want from Garmin Connect, I use the statistical softward to dig deeper into my Foreruner data.

This portfolio demonstrates some of the advanced analytics I've developed using my personal running and cycling data. Each tab to the left demonstrates self-contained analyses:

* Efficient Frontier - compares activities from recent history and evaluates how efficient each run is to the aggregate
* Changepoint Analysis - evaluates changes in performance during recorded activities
* Spacial Analysis - geospacial review of most frequenly-traveled paths
* Trends - reviews historical activity metrics (pace, heart rate, VO2 max, etc) and suggests how they may evolve moving forward
* More - A high-level review of other ideas to implement

All mathematical modeling was performed using the R software package. Source code can be found via the following Github repository: [https://github.com/johnsug/garmin](https://github.com/johnsug/garmin)
